# Fourier-Composed-with-Mobius

(1) Evaluate the "Fourier - Draw Text - Mobius Modification" notebook first to get parametric functions x[t] and y[t] for the Mobius notebook.
    Be sure to choose an appropriate picture for the Fourier Transform, the code works best with continuous and connected images. Text connected with an underline works nicely.
(2) Evaluate the  "Rotating Riemann Sphere - No Controller - Grid" notebook in the same kernel so that it has access to the x[t] and y[t] made in the previous step.

Note the the Manipulation module is computationally intensive.

You can call individual plots with f[alpha, beta, gamma, a, b, cr].

alpha is the angle about the x axis, beta the y axis, and gamma the z axis.

(a,b) is the ordered pair for a project circle with a radius of cr. (all of which is obsolete in this verison of the code, defaults are all 0, please disregard these values).
